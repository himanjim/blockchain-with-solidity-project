# Sample Hardhat Project
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2c0ee4f57fe57a00d6f7c73b7e976d9dc8ae07c1#events


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
